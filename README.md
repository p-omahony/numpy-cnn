## Numpy implementation of a simple Convolution Neural Network
The goal of this project is to solve the MNIST problem by implementing a CNN only with the numpy library. It is not to have the best possible performance but rather to implement the forward and backward propagation algorithms from scratch.  

## Install & run
1. clone this repo
2. create a virtual environement with venv for example
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python -B main.py`
